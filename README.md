vimlike-extended
================

This is a fork of the vimlike Safari extension, found at:

http://code.google.com/p/vimlike-onsafari/

It contains the following changes:

- Scrolling commands (h, j, k, l) now correctly scroll in one dimension without affecting the other.
- Added support for ex-mode, which you can enter by pressing ':' and exit by pressing escape.
- Added the ':e' command, which loads a new web page. "http://" will be added automatically if no protocol is specified.
- Added the ':gr' command, which performs a google search.
